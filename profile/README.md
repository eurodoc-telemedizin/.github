The Virtual Patient AI System comprises a suite of integrated technologies designed to deliver comprehensive healthcare solutions. It augments clinical decision-making while preserving practitioner autonomy and patient privacy. Central to this system is the Virtual Patient BRAIN integrating the patients medical history, powered by the on-premises LLM model, ensuring enhanced control and security. Clinical guidelines are seamlessly incorporated through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) via locally-hosted MedlibreGPT, our specialized adaptation of PrivateGPT. Online patient consultations are facilitated by AI-Twin Chatbots, which accurately emulate healthcare practitioners' expertise.
