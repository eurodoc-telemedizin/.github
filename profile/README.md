# Virtual Patient AI
Transforming healthcare through AI-powered virtual consultations - where clinical expertise meets secure, scalable telemedicine for better patient outcomes.

Virtual Patient AI is an open-source healthcare platform transforming clinical decision-making, telemedicine, and medical training.

- **Clinical Foundation Model:** Built on MedlibreGPT, the system integrates individual medical histories and clinical guidelines, enhancing decision support while preserving doctor autonomy and patient privacy.
- **AI-Twin Chatbots:** Enables realistic, scalable online consultations and virtual patient interactions for both healthcare delivery and education.
- **Robust Architecture:** Combines on-premises and cloud-based language models, secure Nextcloud integration, and hybrid EHR solutions—ensuring interoperability and cost efficiency.
- **Unmatched Security & Privacy:** All data is processed and stored locally, with offline capability and blockchain timestamping for tamper-proof, court-admissible medical records.
- **Proven Impact:** Already improving outcomes in dental and plastic surgery care, with transparent, verifiable records that meet GDPR/HIPAA standards.

Virtual Patient AI is setting a new standard for trustworthy, scalable, and privacy-first telemedicine and medical education—addressing urgent market needs and positioning itself as the backbone for next-generation healthcare platforms.

Eurodoc develops the Virtual Patient System AI, building on our pioneering work in Augmented Reality image-guided surgery and teleconsultation from the 1990s. At the Medical University Vienna, we achieved the first clinical implementation of Augmented Reality Image Guided Surgery. We [**patented**](https://patents.google.com/patent/US5823958A/en?oq=US5823958A) the [**see-through display technology**](https://consultation.medlibre.ai/wvn) and published clinical results. The system utilized a see-through HMD featuring a camera for surgical site recording and a 3D sensor for head movement tracking. We also [patented](https://patents.google.com/patent/US5678546A/en?oq=US5678546A) the calibration process for aligning augmented reality overlays with real-world vision. The Virtual Patient System has received CE clearance as a Class IIa device and accumulated more than 2,800 [**international references**](https://scholar.google.at/citations?hl=de&user=ABDceFgAAAAJ). The Virtual Patient AI concept emerges from our extensive teleconsultation research.

In 1996, Dr. Michael Truppe published a [groundbreaking paper on augmented reality surgery](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/2395/1/Interventional-video-tomography/10.1117/12.209096.short) and see-through head-mounted displays—laying the foundation for modern surgical applications of HMDs like the Apple Vision Pro.
